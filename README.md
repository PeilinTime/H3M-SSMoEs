## How to Run Our Model ðŸš€

### 1. Download this repository

Download or clone this code repository to your local machine.

### 2. For Training and Prediction

Download one of the datasets from the Google Drive link above:

* DJIA: `djia_alpha158_alpha360.pt` & `djia_news_embeddings.pt` & `timestamps_embedding.pt`
* NASDAQ100: `nas100_alpha158_alpha360.pt` & `nas100_news_embeddings.pt` & `timestamps_embedding.pt`
* S&P100: `sp100_alpha158_alpha360.pt` & `sp100_news_embeddings.pt` & `timestamps_embedding.pt`

Place the downloaded files in the same directory as the codebase.
Run the following command to train the model and make predictions (including training, validation, and test sets):

```bash
python run.py
```

### 3. For Backtesting

Download the datasets **and** the corresponding model weights from the two links above:

* DJIA: `djia_alpha158_alpha360.pt` & `djia_news_embeddings.pt` & `timestamps_embedding.pt` **and** `DJIA_weight.pth`
* NASDAQ100: `nas100_alpha158_alpha360.pt` & `nas100_news_embeddings.pt` & `timestamps_embedding.pt` **and** `NASDAQ100_weight.pth`
* S&P100: `sp100_alpha158_alpha360.pt` & `sp100_news_embeddings.pt` & `timestamps_embedding.pt` **and** `SP100_weight.pth`

Place the downloaded files in the same directory as the codebase.
Run the following command to perform backtesting and results:

```bash
python backtesting.py
```
